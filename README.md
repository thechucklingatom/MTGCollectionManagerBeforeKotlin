# MTGCollectionManager
My android learning project, making a collection manager for magic the gathering, will not be monetized and a portfolio style app.
This is a portfolio app that I am working on and a personal project to manage my card collection. I may end up having some help from my 
younger brother to give him some programming experience as well. I plan on adding the ability to fetch images at some point, but due to 
potential copyright issues I may not implement that.
